# ARCHER with 2FA FROM PUMA

These are some tips for transfering from ARCHER to ARCHER 2 (access via PUMA)

## information

NCAS CMS have some usefull information on how to modify your suite.



* LINUX must be set to background (from at)
* site/archer.rc and ncas_cray  might be required to run

### Met office password cahce
`mosrs-cache-password `

### Permission errors
```
rm -f  ~/.ssh/environment.puma
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add -D
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_archerum
```
weird FCM make permission error... not always ? Sometimes runs fine ?


# ARCHER 2

[CMS UM on archer 2 pages](http://cms.ncas.ac.uk/wiki/Archer2#UM)

Note nothing will work out of the box.

1. Follow on boarding instructions
2. run example suite
  1. ~/.bash_profile  edit on ARCHER 2
  2. edit or add `site/archer2.rc` type file or `site/ncas_cray_ex/suite-adds.rc`
      * `--chdir=/work/n02/n02/<your ARCHER2 user name>`  line must be edited

# SLURM COMMANDS

* `sinfo`  information on nodes available
* `squeue -l | grep $USER` check if your jobs are running
* `squeue -l | grep PENDING | wc -l` how long is the queue
* `squeue -R shortqos` check the short queue

# Gotchas

* WALLCLOCK LIMIT is in minutes not seconds there 60 is 1 hour not 1 min
this can be fixed editing `bin/setup_metadata`
```
fp.write("WALL_CLOCK_LIMIT=20\n")
fp.write("range=1:172800\n")
```
and `meta/rose-meta.conf` swapping `range=60:172800` to `range=1:172800`
* Node is 8x8 CPUS (actually 128 cores as hyper threaded)
* Python mismatches - if loading in cray-python must load after other cyclc tasks and unload in after in pre scripts
* Nesting Suite archer suite had reference to short partition which does not exist short q is accessed by short reservation on standard partition
* short q limited to 1 running 1 queuing



# Archer2 new 23 cabinet system


## Host Key verification failed / submit failed

`[FAIL] Host key verification failed.`

Occurs because Archer2 now has a different key the 4 cabinet system

`ssh-keygen -R login.archer2.ac.uk`

should resolve it

some users might need to check there's no other toublesome keys

`ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no  login.archer2.ac.uk`
might pop up a warning:

`Warning: the ECDSA host key for 'login.archer2.ac.uk' differs from the key for the IP address '193.62.216.45'``

telling you the other offending key to remove e.g.:

`ssh-keygen -R 193.62.216.45`

Now you should have no more mismatching keys. (possibly you'll need to repeat this step a few times to cover all the ip addresses!)

*NB only do this when you are expecting the keys to mismatch - otherwise a key mismatch could highlight something malicious*

## Module fails

Job fails with error logs not finding modules

`module restore module` yields : `Lmod has detected the following error:  User module collection: "2020.12.14" does not exist.`

`module restore` is no longer a command. `module load um` will load um modules

## Transitioning to 23-cab from 4 cab

Main files that need altering:

`site/ncas-cray-ex/suite-adds.rc`

all `module restore` commands must be modified to something like:

```bash
export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/work/n02/n02/simon/modulefiles
module load um
```

the CAP9.1 path must be altered

```bash
# replace
# export PATH=/work/n02/n02/grenvill/CAP9.1/build/bin:$PATH
# with
export PATH=/work/y07/shared/umshared/CAP9.1/build/bin:$PATH
```

CAP9 path must also be altered in:

`app/install_cold/opt/rose-app-ncas-cray-ex.conf`

```bash
# replace
# source=/work/n02/n02/grenvill/CAP9.1/build/bin
# with
source=/work/y07/shared/umshared/CAP9.1/build/bin
```

*UM source code mods*

Depending on which version of the UM more or less modifications will be required:

find the um source closest to your suites from this list:

[http://cms.ncas.ac.uk/wiki/Archer2](http://cms.ncas.ac.uk/wiki/Archer2)

and find the corresponding branch on the [trac um browser](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/browser)

find the revision log for the "cce12 fixes"

e.g. for vn 11.2 the following files need to be modified

```
atmosphere/AC_assimilation/getobs.F90 (4 diffs)
atmosphere/UKCA/ukca_activ_mod.F90 (1 diff)
atmosphere/UKCA/ukca_calc_drydiam.F90 (2 diffs)
atmosphere/UKCA/ukca_volume_mode.F90 (6 diffs)
atmosphere/boundary_layer/bdy_expl2.F90 (2 diffs)
utility/qxreconf/rcf_h_int_nearest_mod.F90 (2 diffs)
```

### Troubleshooting:

1. Access issue
 `ssh login.archer2.ac.uk`

 returns

 `PTY allocation request failed on channel 0`
 `bash: /home1/z00/puma-access-route/bin/pumawrapper: No such file or
 directory`

check the path in

 `/home1/system/puma-access-route/keys/$USER`

 `/home1/z00/` should be `/home1/system/`
